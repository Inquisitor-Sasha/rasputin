Even with authentication, a web based application is still very vulnerable to attack and presents a severe security risk.  You are strongly advised not to use this as a method of controlling a remote server.  None of the developers of this tool are responsible in any way for bad stuff that might arise should you be an idiot with it.

Use of this application as a penetration tool is intended to be white hat and ethical.  As a penetration tester, you should also be responsible.  Do not use this application for any immoral or illegal purpose.  If you use this tool for ethical penetration testing, don't be an idiot with it; do not put it on the public internet without some form of authentication required to access it or on a private network where it could be abused by other people if they access it.  Make sure that you remove any installations of this application when you are finished testing or demonstrating it.  The program is designed to provide access, not security.
